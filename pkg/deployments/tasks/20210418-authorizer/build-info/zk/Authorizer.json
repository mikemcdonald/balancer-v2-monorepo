If a delay is set for an action, users\n * are instead allowed to schedule an execution that will be run in the future by the Authorizer instead of executing it\n * directly themselves.\n *\n * Glossary:\n * - Action: Operation that can be performed to a target contract. These are identified by a unique bytes32 `actionId`\n *   defined by each target contract following `IAuthentication.getActionId`.\n * - Scheduled execution: The Authorizer can define different delays per `actionId` in order to determine that a\n *   specific time window must pass before these can be executed. When a delay is set for an `actionId`, executions\n *   must be scheduled. These executions are identified with an unsigned integer called `scheduledExecutionId`.\n * - Permission: Unique identifier to refer to a user (who) that is allowed to perform an action (what) in a specific\n *   target contract (where). This identifier is called `permissionId` and is computed as\n *   `keccak256(actionId, account, where)`.\n *\n * Permission granularity:\n *   In addition to the who/what/where of a permission, an extra notion of a \"specifier\" is introduced to enable more\n *   granular configuration. This concept is used within the Authorizer to provide clarity among four ambiguous actions:\n *   granting/revoking permissions, executing scheduled actions, and setting action delays. For example, in managing\n *   the permission to set action delays, it is desirable to delineate whether an account can set delays for all\n *   actions indiscriminately or only for a specific action ID. In this case, the permission's \"baseActionId\" is the\n *   action ID for scheduling a delay change, and the \"specifier\" is the action ID for which the delay will be changed.\n *   The \"baseActionId\" and \"specifier\" of a permission are combined into a single \"extended\" `actionId`\n *   by calling `getExtendedActionId(baseActionId, specifier)`.\n *\n * Note that the TimelockAuthorizer doesn't make use of reentrancy guards on the majority of external functions.\n * The only function which makes an external non-view call (and so could initate a reentrancy attack) is `execute`\n * which executes a scheduled execution and so this is the only protected function.\n * In fact a number of the TimelockAuthorizer's functions may only be called through a scheduled execution so reentrancy\n * is necessary in order to be able to call these.\n */\ncontract TimelockAuthorizer is IAuthorizer, IAuthentication, ReentrancyGuard {\n    using Address for address;\n\n    /**\n     * @notice An action specifier which grants a general permission to perform all variants of the base action.\n     */\n    bytes32\n        public constant GENERAL_PERMISSION_SPECIFIER = 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff;\n    // solhint-disable-previous-line max-line-length\n\n    /**\n     * @notice A sentinel value for `where` that will match any address.\n     */\n    address public constant EVERYWHERE = address(-1);\n\n    // We institute a maximum delay to ensure that actions cannot be accidentally/maliciously disabled through setting\n    // an arbitrarily long delay.\n    uint256 public constant MAX_DELAY = 2 * (365 days);\n    // We need a minimum delay period to ensure that scheduled actions may be properly scrutinised.\n    uint256 public constant MIN_DELAY = 5 days;\n\n    struct ScheduledExecution {\n        address where;\n        bytes data;\n        bool executed;\n        bool cancelled;\n        bool protected;\n        uint256 executableAt;\n    }\n\n    // solhint-disable var-name-mixedcase\n    bytes32 public immutable GRANT_ACTION_ID;\n    bytes32 public immutable REVOKE_ACTION_ID;\n    bytes32 public immutable EXECUTE_ACTION_ID;\n    bytes32 public immutable SCHEDULE_DELAY_ACTION_ID;\n\n    // These action ids do not need to be used by external actors as the action ids above do.\n    // Instead they're saved just for gas savings so we can keep them private.\n    bytes32 private immutable _GENERAL_GRANT_ACTION_ID;\n    bytes32 private immutable _GENERAL_REVOKE_ACTION_ID;\n\n    TimelockExecutor private immutable _executor;\n    IAuthentication private immutable _vault;\n    uint256 private immutable _rootTransferDelay;\n\n    address private _root;\n    address private _pendingRoot;\n    ScheduledExecution[] private _scheduledExecutions;\n    mapping(bytes32 => bool) private _isPermissionGranted;\n    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) private _delaysPerActionId;\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Emitted when a new execution `scheduledExecutionId` is scheduled.\n     */\n    event ExecutionScheduled(bytes32 indexed actionId, uint256 indexed scheduledExecutionId);\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Emitted when an execution `scheduledExecutionId` is executed.\n     */\n    event ExecutionExecuted(uint256 indexed scheduledExecutionId);\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Emitted when an execution `scheduledExecutionId` is cancelled.\n     */\n    event ExecutionCancelled(uint256 indexed scheduledExecutionId);\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Emitted when a new `delay` is set in order to perform action `actionId`.\n     */\n    event ActionDelaySet(bytes32 indexed actionId, uint256 delay);\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Emitted when `account` is granted permission to perform action `actionId` in target `where`.\n     */\n    event PermissionGranted(bytes32 indexed actionId, address indexed account, address indexed where);\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Emitted when `account`'s permission to perform action `actionId` in target `where` is revoked.\n     */\n    event PermissionRevoked(bytes32 indexed actionId, address indexed account, address indexed where);\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Emitted when a new `root` is set.\n     */\n    event RootSet(address indexed root);\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Emitted when a new `pendingRoot` is set.
